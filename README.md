# Solana Starter

Welcome to **Solana Starter**! This repository serves as a boilerplate for developing decentralized applications (dApps) on the [Solana blockchain](https://solana.com/). With this project, you can quickly set up and start building your Solana-based application using modern tools and best practices.

## Features

- **TypeScript-first**: The project is built using TypeScript for type safety and developer productivity.
- **Rust Support**: Includes support for writing Solana programs (smart contracts) in Rust.
- **Pre-configured Tools**: Comes with a set of tools and libraries for seamless development.
- **Scalable Architecture**: A modular and scalable project structure to help you grow your dApp.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **Yarn** (or npm)
- **Rust** (with `cargo` and Solana toolchain)
- **Solana CLI** ([installation guide](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools))

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tenrikut/solana-starter.git
   cd solana-starter
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Build the Solana programs (Rust):
   ```bash
   cd programs
   cargo build-bpf
   cd ..
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

5. Deploy your Solana program (optional):
   ```bash
   solana program deploy path/to/program.so
   ```

## Project Structure

- **/src**: Contains the frontend application written in TypeScript.
- **/programs**: Contains Solana smart contracts written in Rust.
- **/tests**: End-to-end tests for the dApp and smart contracts.
- **/scripts**: Automate tasks like deployment and testing.

## Scripts

Here are some useful commands:

- **`yarn start`**: Start the local development server.
- **`yarn build`**: Build the frontend for production.
- **`cargo build-bpf`**: Build the Solana smart contracts.
- **`yarn test`**: Run the test suite.
